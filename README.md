# coding-assignment
For this project, the focus is on the factors that influence life expectancy (superficial).  
I used the "worldbank-lifeexpectancyPermalink" data from the Gabors Data Analysis website page, and I also downloaded the same dimensions of government health expenditure per capita from the World Bank data (the raw data).
Firstly I fixed the quality errors (string vs number and missing values) in both sets of data and saved the results in dta format. Then I aggregated the two data sets, filtered them, and generated the corresponding log values (the derived data). Finally, I ran a least squares regression and created a graph. All codes and results have been saved.
